- The bathtub: The bathtub represents K's subconscious mind, where he tries to escape from his problems and his addiction. It also symbolizes his rebirth and transformation, as he emerges from the water in a new state.
- The lighter: The lighter is K's prized possession, which he inherited from his father. It represents his attachment to his past and his identity as a smoker. It also serves as a trigger for his addiction, as he constantly flicks it on and off.
- The maze: The maze is a metaphor for K's life, which is full of twists and turns, confusion and uncertainty. It also reflects his struggle to find a way out of his addiction and his predicament.
- The army base: The army base is a manifestation of K's nightmares, which are influenced by his childhood trauma of witnessing his father's death in a war. It also represents his fear of losing control and being punished for his actions.

No Smoking is a movie that challenges the conventional norms of storytelling and cinema. It does not follow a linear or logical narrative, but rather jumps from one scene to another, leaving gaps and clues for the viewers to fill in. It does not spoon-feed the audience with explanations or resolutions, but rather invites them to form their own opinions and interpretations. It does not cater to the expectations or preferences of the mainstream audience, but rather experiments with different genres and styles.
  
No Smoking is a movie that deserves more appreciation and recognition. It is a bold and innovative film that pushes the boundaries of Indian cinema. It is a film that offers a unique and stimulating experience for those who are willing to watch it with an open mind.
