The campaign featured posters of the two rival characters from the movie, Ramadhir Singh and Faizal Khan, who were portrayed as candidates competing for votes in the upcoming elections. The posters were strategically placed in various locations across the two cities, such as railway stations, bus stops, and market areas, to attract the attention of the public and generate curiosity about the film.[32][33]

The campaign was inspired by the plot of the movie, which revolves around the power struggle between two families in the coal mafia of Wasseypur, a town in Bihar. The movie is divided into two parts, each spanning several decades and generations. The first part was released in June 2012 and received critical acclaim and commercial success. The second part was scheduled to release in August 2012 and aimed to capitalize on the popularity of the first part.
  
The posters featured slogans such as "Ramadhir Singh for Prime Minister" and "Faizal Khan for Chief Minister", along with images of the actors who played them, Tigmanshu Dhulia and Nawazuddin Siddiqui respectively. The posters also had a QR code that led to the official website of the movie, where viewers could watch the trailer and other promotional videos. The campaign was designed to create a sense of realism and immersion for the audience, as well as to generate word-of-mouth publicity for the movie.

The campaign was conceived and executed by Fox Star Studios, the distributor of the movie, in collaboration with Phantom Films, the production house. The director of the movie, Anurag Kashyap, praised the campaign and said that it was a unique and innovative way of marketing a movie. He also said that he hoped that the campaign would spark a debate among the people about the issues raised in the movie, such as corruption, violence, and politics.[32][33]
